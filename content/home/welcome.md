<!-- The **Wowchemy Research Group** has been a center of excellence for Artificial Intelligence research, teaching, and practice since its founding in 2016. -->
Deep learning has become the hottest area in machine learning, data science and AI. We launch this meetup group for the following communities (but not limited to): data scientists/researchers who have interest and/or skills in deep learning developers who like to build applications based on it, companies/organisations who are adopting it to tackle the most challenge problems, and investors/entrepreneurs who would like to invest and start business using deep learning technologies.

Please join us! We will meet and explore more in this exciting area together!
